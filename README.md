# TDT4195 - Visual Computing Fundamentals

## Course content
Half of the course is concerned with image syntesis (computer graphics) and half of the course is on image analysis (image processing).

### Graphics
graphical primitives, rasterization, anti-aliasing, clipping, geometric transformations, viewing transformations, hierarchical scene modelling, culling and hidden surface elimination, colour representation, illumination models and algorithms. C/C++ OpenGL labs.

### Image processing
introduction to and examples of image processing and simple image analysis applications. Intro to deep learning based image interpretation and understanding (fully-connected neural networks and CNNs). Filtering and image enhancement in both the spatial domain as well as in the frequency / Fourier domain. Various image segmentation methods and mathematical morphology. Labs with assignments and Python (alternatively MATLAB).
